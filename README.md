Kleyzmeron is a small App that has three operations: calculate 10% discount, round for nice visuality and copy to clipboard.
  The rounding algorithm is as follows:
 <BR>if last digit = 0, 5, 9 -> keep digit.
 <BR>if last digit = 1, 2 -> round to 0.
 <BR>if last digit = 3, 4, 6 -> round to 5.
 <BR>if last digit = 7, 8 -> round to 9.
 <BR>If last digit = 0, 5, 9 -> keep digit.
 <BR>If last digit = 1, 2 -> round to 0.
 <BR>If last digit = 3, 4, 6 -> round to 5.
 <BR>If last digit = 7, 8 -> round to 9.
